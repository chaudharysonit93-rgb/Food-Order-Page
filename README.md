# Food-Order-Page
This project is a simple, single-page Food Order website created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. It features a visually appealing food-themed background image, title, tagline, and a “Book Now” button. Built as part of my NIAT Jaipur frontend learning journey to strengthen HTML structure, CSS styling, and layout design skills.
